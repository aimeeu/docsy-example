At this past Saturday’s lesson, Bond and I did something we had never done before – we helped round up 4 adults and 8 lambs, move them into the barn, separate into two groups, and then move them into box stalls.

After I arrived, the conversation went something like this:
B: “The sheep are in the barn. We just have to move them into the box stalls before the shearer comes.”
Me: “You mean those sheep in the pasture? The ones staring at us?”
B: “How did they get out??”
Me: “I saw them busting out as I pulled up.”
B: “Well now you and Bond will have to get them back in the barn. The most protective mom is with the lambs. Grab your stick but leave your leash in the car.”
Me: “What?!? No leash in the barn?”
B: “Bond can do this.”

The three woollies are the heaviest, but the ewe and lambs are some of the lightest, so it was an interesting challenge. The sheep were in the bottom of an L-shaped pasture, maybe 1.5-2 acres? We moved them towards the sheep door on the side of the barn… and they all ran past into the top part of the pasture, stopping with the winter feeders between them and me/Bond. We moved forward, they moved towards the top of the L. Bond really had to WALK and remain calm to gather them and bring them back. Bond is very enthusiastic, so this much self-control was a challenge.  I stopped Bond on the far side of the winter feeders as the sheep went around the corner of the barn towards the sheep door. They went in! Bonnie closed the sheep door.

Next step was moving the sheep from the hay side into the stall side of the barn (see photo).  The dividers in the hay side are between 3-6’ tall. The door between the two sides of the barn was closed. The plan was for Bond to move the sheep into the “hay feeders area” then move back to position A to keep the sheep off the door. Then open the door completely across the alleyway, send Bond on a go-bye towards the “very narrow gate” to move the sheep away from the feeders and through the open door. I am amazed at how well Bond worked! He walked and mostly hugged the barn walls, totally focused on the stock. Took a few tries since the sheep really wanted to either be in the top corner or by the sheep door, but Bond and I managed to get them into the “hay feeders” area. I called him back to “A”, Bonnie opened the door, I sent Bond on a go-bye, he ducked through the “very narrow gate” and followed the sheep into the stall side of the barn.    

The plan for the stall side was to split the stock into two groups, put the woolly sheep into box stall 1, and put the protective mom and 8 lambs into box stall 2. The sheep had other plans. They were all crowded in the corner by the cow panel gate that opens onto a ramp into the pasture… testing, plotting. Whereas the mom and lambs prefer to be as far away from the dog as possible, two of the heavy woollies will challenge and charge an unsure dog. So it was an interesting mix. Again Bond stuck to the barn walls, crawling over, under, around, through because the sheep decided there was no way they were going into either of the open box stalls. Bonnie talked us through, and eventually we did split the stock and get the woollies into box stall 1 and the others into box stall 2. Bond was so good, especially with taking directions from two people. Oh no! Three of the lambs had escaped the barn and were in the pasture! Bleating from the pasture, bleating from the barn!  We had start all over with the three lambs on the lam! It was a repeat of earlier. The lambs ran past the sheep door and ended up in the top pasture.
